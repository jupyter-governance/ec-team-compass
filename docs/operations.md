# Executive Council Operational Details

## How decisions are made

The Jupyter Executive Council follows the
[Decision Making Guidelines](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making) described in the main Jupyter governance documents.

In short, we'll first seek an informal consensus. If a clear consensus cannot be reached, an active council member can call for a vote. The voting process then follows the guidelines laid out by the [Jupyter Governance model](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making).

## Process for adding meeting minutes

We use meeting minutes to communicate our major conversations externally, with the goal of providing transparency to the Jupyter contributor community. Public minutes can added as long as two JEC members have looked at them (the author, and one other person).

After JEC meetings, any JEC team member should summarize the main ideas of our discussion. Try to be short and to-the-point. Make a pull-request to a file in [the `meeting_notes/` folder](https://github.com/jupyter-governance/ec-team-compass/tree/main/docs/meeting_notes).

Any other team member is encouraged to merge that pull request.

## Code of Conduct

The Jupyter Executive Council follows the broader [Jupyter Community's Code of
Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html)
