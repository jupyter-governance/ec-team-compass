# Meeting Notes from 2023 Q1

## 28 March 2023

### Attendees
- Afshin T. Darian
- Ana Ruvalcaba
- Steven Silvester
- Jason Grout
- Fernando Perez
- Brian Granger

### Decisions made
- Steve and Ana bootstrap the Social Media Working Group as Editors-in-Chief. They will nominate a pool of Associate Editors to manage most individual decisions.
    - They will create a draft of the charter/guidelines for social media and start the bootstrapping of people for that WG.

### Agenda and minutes
- JupyterCon travel funding update
- Brief update on CoC committee
    - CoC language hasn't been reviewed since its inception.
    - Maybe worth reviewing/updating based on experience and evolution in this space.
    - For JupyterCon, we'll be under the NF umbrella in this regard.
    - As of this moment, any CoC issue would come to the EC.
    - Given we're already using the NF one - could we potentially adopt it wholesale? It's an option to at least evaluate.
    - Another suggestion from astropy (Moritz Gunther): NF create an ombuds office that supports individual projects that may struggle with CoC issues.
- Update on social media working group
- Update on permissions
- DEI Charter feedback provided directly on the GH issue:

- Afshin Darian
- Brian Granger
- Fernando Perez

### Agenda and minutes
- Incubation process and contrib orgs
    - There is ongoing confusion about the contrib (jupyterlab-contrib) orgs that we need to address.
    - Obviously, anyone is free to do open source work outside of Jupyter. However, the jupyterlab-contrib org is owned by JupyterLab Council members, official Jupyter work is being done there, and council members are recommending that early stage JupyterLab and Jupyter Server work be done there.
        - For example, https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit has been approved by the JupyterLab council as the official UI toolkit for JupyterLab
        - See https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass/issues/172 for another example.
    - Essentially, jupyterlab-contrib is functioning as an incubator org for JupyterLab, and this is confusing users and developers.
    - The confusion is problematic as jupyterlab-contrib has no code-of-conduct, no governance, and some Jupyter contributors can’t (legally) contribute to jupyterlab-contrib.
    - The root cause is that the Jupyter incubator program is essentially dormant/dead.
    - Reviving the incubator program and figuring out what to do with the contrib orgs would be a great thing for the SSC to dive into.
    - https://github.com/jupyter-incubator - an official place in Project Jupyter for incubating projects, listed in the governance docs
- Creating opportunities for EC+SSC to meet
    - Fundraising
    - JupyterCon in-person meeting for EC+SSC
        - Starting point would be to define a set of desired outcomes / agenda, we can then decide how much time we need and what format would be best
        - Should be after, not before
        - Hopefully not during sprints, as the SSC members may really want to be at the sprints

        - Maybe have the afternoon of Tuesday, then dinner Tuesday night?
        - Because of COVID, consider making the dinner outdoors
- Have another regular meeting. 1 day of EC+SSC, then one or two days of broader Union of Councils meetings. Perhaps one day for subproject councils to meet (there there is lots of overlap)
- Suppose we fundraise to have each subproject council to meet once a year?
