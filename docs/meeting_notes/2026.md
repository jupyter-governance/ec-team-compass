### Notes

* Roadmap Methodology
    * Top-down (EC-led) vs. Bottom-up (sub-project led) planning. 
        * Middle-ground approach = Understanding individual sub-project strategies first, then weaving them into a cohesive project-wide vision.
    * The roadmap should result in concrete actions and priorities, ensuring development time is aligned with high-level goals.
    * The EC should provide thematic direction rather than tactical instructions to maintain a balance between strategic vision and practical execution.
* Potential Technical Focuses
    * Jupyter AI
        * Might be a cross-cutting initiative
    * Notebook Core Improvements
    * Language Kernels
* Community and Organization
    * [Jason] The Executive Council should focus more on community building and growing contributors than dictating technical directions.
    * [Zach] Use Directly Responsible Individuals (DRIs) to drive community energy and progress on specific issues.
    * [Darian] Improved accessibility should be core.
