### Notes
- Discussed transitioning Zoom meetings from NumFOCUS to LF zoom
  - Jason is leading the Zoom transition, and will reach out to the SSC to work with subprojects on a transition plan
  - Experimented with how LF Zoom meetings work, how recording can work, etc. It appears we have all of the capabilities we need.
  - Decision: we can use zoom links that go through the LFX portal (which requires people putting in their email address and/or name, depending on the meeting settings), or we can use direct zoom links. We decided to use direct zoom links in our transition to make the switch seamless.
  - NumFOCUS told us we had some time to make the transition

  - Discussed ongoing logistics of the transition
    - Updating Project Jupyter information in LFX Insights
    - There are tidelift funds at NumFOCUS that need to be moved over to LF Charities, and we need to put future tidelift contributions into LF Charities.
