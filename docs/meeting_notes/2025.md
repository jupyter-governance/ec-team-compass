## Apr 29, 2025

### Attendees

* Ana Ruvalcaba
* Jason Grout
* Chris Holdgraf
* Zach Sailer joined at 9:37am

### Notes

* Discussion: Documentation support for Jupyter: Chris shared some notes and discussion from conversations he has been having with projects in the LF ecosystem in order to improve documentation. Docs has been noted as a key area of improvement for both subproject needs and for foundation members. Chris had a meeting with CNCF to learn what kind of system they use to support their subprojects in documenting and shared their system. We discussed the possibility of using foundation funds for this. Concluded that Chris should reach out to the Documentation Working Group to gauge interest in making systemic improvements in documentation for the Jupyter community. Chris will follow up.
* Discussion: Tidelift accounts for Jupyter / Linux Foundation: we discussed whether there is anything we can do to move forward the Tidelift transition to LF. Right now, no. It is bogged down in LF/Tidelift reaching an agreement, and this has been slow both because Tidelift is being acquired, also because LF projects are not the kind of projects that Tidelift usually targets (they target smaller projects generally speaking). It may be some time before this completes and we aren't sure that we have the ability to speed it up.
* Decision: Centralizing PyPI accounts: We [voted on this issue](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/272) and agreed to merge it to move the conversation forward.
* Discussion: Product and strategic vision for Jupyter. A number of stakeholders have said that they'd value having clearer direction and vision for the project as a whole. Both from the Jupyter community, and from the Foundation members. This could be a way to get people excited about shared directions, align efforts, and raise funds. JEC is the the right group to lead this effort, but has limited capacity. We will open an issue to track this moving forward and kick off a discussion. Might use Foundation resources to help with this.


## Apr 22, 2025

### Attendees

* Ana Ruvalcaba
* Jason Grout
* Chris Holdgraf
* Afshin Darian
* Rick Wagner

### Notes

* Triaged and reviewed our EC task board (updated existing GH project and deprecated old google sheet which had fallen out of use).
* Discussed [https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/272](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/272), and the more general issue of administrative control of Project Jupyter spaces and artifacts. We discussed having a relevant principle in the governance docs, and asking the security subproject to drive policies in this area.
* Discussed the need for more capacity in executive leadership and community and stakeholder relations. We are working on shaping a proposal around this.
* Approved prize money for Jupyter Distinguished Contributors cohort that was just selected.
* Discussed a process for the EC prioritizing areas of effort

## Apr 15, 2025

### Attendees

* A. T. Darian
* Rick Wagner
* Ana Ruvalcaba
* Jason Grout
* Zach Sailer

### Notes

* Discussed the [feedback issue from the Jupyter community for funding needs](https://github.com/jupyter-governance/jupyter-foundation-governing-board/issues/1) and how we can most effectively engage there. Will follow up in that issue with an update about where we've been prioritizing our time.
* Discussed the importance for having more regular communication out of the JEC meetings and progress throughout the week. We noted a capacity challenge due to being a volunteer group with a lot to do. Our goals will be to prioritize providing updates in issues, Discourse posts, etc that are low-effort, rather than "formal communication".
* Refined proposal for the Jupyter Foundation goals and strategy to get agreement from the Foundation and posted on the Jupyter Foundation Team Compass ([compass.jupyterfoundation.org](http://compass.jupyterfoundation.org/))Discussed [this Jupyter Desktop issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop/issues/890) and noted that directing community attention to these kinds of issues, and facilitating conversations around it, is the kind of thing the Foundation could support. General feeling that the issue is complex and the right information / conversations haven't happened to make a clear decision in a "formal" sense from the JEC.

## Mar 04, 2025

### Attendees

* Zach Sailer
* Afshin Darian
* Chris Holdgraf
* Rick Wagner
* Jason Grout

### Notes

- **Process agreement for the EC.** We agreed that it’s important for the EC to trust one another’s judgment, and to bias towards action rather than asking the group for approval for everything in order to improve our efficiency, particularly when the decisions are easily reversible.
- **Project Management capacity from LF.** We discussed whether the Jupyter Foundation should contract Project Management capacity from the Linux Foundation in order to assist us in administrative duties. Major concerns were that the cost of a LF PM is relatively high. Our likely plan will be to try a scoped trial period to learn more about how the PM can help the foundation be more effective, and decide how we’d like to move forward once we have more experience.
- **Foundation growth plans.** We ran through the pipeline of potential foundation members with LF people, and discussed our biggest opportunities and risks to the foundation. We agreed on the importance of ensuring the Foundation delivers clear value to the Jupyter Community, and to the member organizations, and the interests are aligned. That is a short-term target for our time.
- **Facilitation at the LF summit.** The Jupyter Foundation board will meet in-person for the first time at the upcoming LF summit. We discussed whether there is value in using a facilitator to guide the conversation of that group. We decided to recommend this to the Jupyter Foundation Board and if there are no objections, move forward with this.
- **JupyterCon planning.** We are now in the content planning phase of JupyterCon and have identified a program chair. We should be on the lookout for keynote speakers and volunteers that can help with planning.



## Feb 25, 2025

### Attendees

* Jason Grout
* Fernando Pérez
* Ana Ruvalcaba
* Afshin Darian
* Rick Wagner

### Notes

* **Discussion**: engaging the Jupyter Foundation more effectively. What mechanisms should we utilize to secure feedback from the community? How can we provide guidance and support to subprojects? For example, the EC can facilitate the Jupyter Foundation Governing Board approving pbudget for specific initiatives at the upcoming in-person meeting in March.
* **Discussion**: which communication channels does the EC commit to watching \- what are some standards we can implement within our group and expected response times? Reference https://executive-council-team-compass.readthedocs.io
* **JupyterCon**: we’re moving forward and working on launching CFP with the program chair for the event.

### Notes

* Discussion of emeritus EC members potentially forming seed for an Advisory Committee, no decisions made yet
* Discussion of broad EC goals for 2025 (now that we have a new cohort, it’s a good time to re-examine):
  * Make sure launch of Jupyter Foundation is good for the stakeholders: the maintainer community who has been asking for support, the members of the Jupyter Foundation Governing Board, the user community
  * Hold a successful JupyterCon 2025

## Feb 11, 2025

* Discussed who could be a possible JupyterCon Program Chair.
* Discussed how to begin formulating a process to direct funding from Jupyter Foundation to Jupyter Subprojects.
  * The Jupyter Foundation aims to support the community.
  * We started brainstorming how to enable funding to reach maintainers. We will take this conversation to the JF Governing Board to continue brainstorming. Ideally, the process to request funds is lightweight and the EC should help support folks looking to request GB funds.
  * Specifically, we discussed Binder’s long term sustainability/funding. Binder is not just a service for tmp notebooks; it’s critical CI for JupyterLab Pull Request.
* Discussed the topic of transparency in EC elections
  * [https://github.com/jupyter/governance/issues/255](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/issues/255)
  * We discussed the pros/cons of transparent voting; it’s important to acknowledge this isn’t an easy topic. The goal is some folks in this meeting plan to respond to that issue to give more context.
