# Meeting notes from 2025

## 25 February 2025

### Attendees
- Jason Grout
- Fernando Pérez
- Ana Ruvalcaba
- Afshin Darian
- Rick Wagner

### Notes
- Discussion: engaging the Jupyter Foundation more effectively. What mechanisms should we utilize to secure feedback from the community? How can we provide guidance and support to subprojects? For example, the EC can facilitate the Jupyter Foundation Governing Board approving pbudget for specific initiatives at the upcoming in-person meeting in March.
- Discussion: which communication channels does the EC commit to watching - what are some standards we can implement within our group and expected response times? Reference https://executive-council-team-compass.readthedocs.io
- JupyterCon: we’re moving forward and working on launching CFP with the program chair for the event.

### Notes
- Welcomed Rick to the EC! Chris and Fernando were out for a CZI meeting.
- Worked on granting access to all things.
- Brian and Fernando plan to attend the next few meetings to help with the transition.
- Discussed individual plans for the LF Members summit. Rick, Ana, Jason, and Zach are confirmed to attend once finances for travel are settled.
- Discussed who could be a possible JupyterCon Program Chair.
- Discussed how to begin formulating a process to direct funding from Jupyter Foundation to Jupyter Subprojects.
  - The Jupyter Foundation aims to support the community.
  - We started brainstorming how to enable funding to reach maintainers. We will take this conversation to the JF Governing Board to continue brainstorming. Ideally, the process to request funds is lightweight and the EC should help support folks looking to request GB funds.
- Specifically, we discussed Binder's long term sustainability/funding. Binder is not just a service for tmp notebooks; it's critical CI for JupyterLab Pull Request.
- Discussed the topic of transparency in EC elections
  - https://github.com/jupyter/governance/issues/255
  - We discussed the pros/cons of transparent voting; it's important to acknowledge this isn't an easy topic. The goal is some folks in this meeting plan to respond to that issue to give more context.
