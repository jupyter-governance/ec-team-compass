# Standing Committee and Working Groups Reports

There are a number of [Standing Committees and Working Groups](https://jupyter.org/governance/standing_committees_and_working_groups.html) who report to the Executive Council. These reports are due in January and July and are posted here.

## Instructions for publishing a report

To post a report, create a pull request in the team compass repo which adds the report as a new markdown file in the standing committee or working group directory and adds the new file to the `readme.md` file table of contents in that directory. The Executive Council will review and merge the pull request, thereby publishing the report. If private information needs to be communicated to the Executive Council, send an email to the [Executive Council email list](https://jupyter.org/governance/executive_council.html#contacting-the-executive-council).
