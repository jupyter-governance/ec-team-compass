* Community Census Report: talked through recommendations for the onboarding recommendation. Rollin created a checklist for publishing, and we edited and added to it during the meeting. 
* We also discussed how and where we would publish this report. We converged on adding an Executive Summary on our Team Compass and put a link to the PDF. We could then publish that link to a Discourse post. 

## 20 June 2024
* Discussed recommendations for Community Census Report, made good progress on recommendations section and made a plan for writing up remaining content. We’re about ¾ done with writing this report.
* Offboarding: due to work commitments, Rollin Thomas  is planning to exit the committee this month. We thank him for his contributions! His leadership and the time dedicated toward this working group’s effort to conduct community interviews and the report summarizing the results are incredibly valuable to the Jupyter community.  

## 13 June 2024
The meeting 6/13/24 was canceled due to 3 out of the 4 committee members being unable to join. 

## 6 June 2024
* Community Report: per our charter, this working group has quarterly reports due to the Executive Council and an annual blog post for the community. The working group has revised this process to include two reports annually for both the community and the EC. The EC report may include non public portions. In this meeting we finalized content for publishing the EC report for the second half of 2023. This report is past due and is the first public report this working group will generate. 
* Start the EC report for 2024 H1
* Discuss recommendations for Community Census Report

## 30 May 2024
* Communicate to community about public minutes: will create a post on Discourse
* Working group reviewed the report in progress resulting from interviews conducted with each Jupyter Subproject. In this meeting we discussed and flesh out specific recommendations from the JCB survey report. Current areas of discussion:
  * Establishing a budget request process for subprojects to request funds/resources from EC
  * Regular program of cross-subproject virtual and in-person meetings

## 23 May 2024
* EC Reports: We reviewed and discussed 2023 H2 (second half of 2023) and discussed 2024 H1. This led to discussion surrounding cadence of reports and led to a bigger conversation about transparency and weekly minutes. 
* Transparency: Improving transparency for this working group
* Public minutes need to be established. Jason will create a place in the EC team compass for our weekly public minutes
* Reviewed options for publishing minutes on GH
  * POV of non engineer - GH is not user friendly, can be confusing
  * Maintainer Summit - Jason attended
    * Jason feels like we have GH’s ear about feedback we want to give about functionality and features. If we encounter issues we should keep that in mind. Figure out what our top ask is if we want to submit. 
* Community Interviews: Tabled the discussion of recommendations in the community survey report in favor of discussion above
