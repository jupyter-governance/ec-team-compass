# Accounts and login in formation

(passwords)=
## 1Password

We share all Jupyter passwords in a 1Password account.
All JEC team members should have access to this account.
If you do not, ask another team member for access.

## E-mail and Google account

We have a shared GMail account at `projectjupyter@gmail.com`.
This is used as a common login for many services and tools that we use.
See [](#paswords) for login credentials.

## Google Calendar

The Jupyter-wide Google Calendar is managed by the Jupyter Google account.
Any JEC member can modify the entries by logging in under the Google account and modifying them directly.

Alternatively, you can delegate rights to your own Google account for modifying the calendar.
