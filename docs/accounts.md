# Accounts and login information

(passwords)=
## 1Password

We share all Jupyter passwords in a 1Password account.
All JEC team members should have access to this account.
If you do not, ask another team member for access.

**Prefer delegating to user accounts over using the shared account**. 1Password lets you [delegate access and authority to user accounts](https://1password.com/features/user-management/) which is preferred over using the shared account.

## Google Workspace account

Each EC member has access to a Google Workspace account tied to the jupyter.org domain. This workspace account hosts shared drives, jupyter.org google groups, and other infrastructure. The account names are of the form first.last@jupyter.org.

## E-mail and Google account

We have a shared GMail account at `projectjupyter@gmail.com`. This is different from the Google Workspaces account defined above, and is from earlier phases of the project.
This is used as a common login for many services and tools that we use.

**To access the Jupyter gmail account** ask a team member to add you as a "delegated user" if you do not know how to do it.
Delegated accounts appear with a key symbol followed by `delegated` in the user switcher.

## Google Calendar

The [Jupyter-wide Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=bTNoZWs2OWRhZzczODF1bXQ4a2NqZDc1dTRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) is a shared calendar for all of Jupyter's events.
Editing rights to this calendar is given out on a person-by-person basis.
All JEC members should have the ability to edit this calendar.
If you want edit access, ask another member of the JEC to add you to this calendar.

**To add events**, from your personal Google account, open the calendar app, create an event, and select the **Project Jupyter** calendar.

(cloudflare)=
## CloudFlare for URLs and DNS

Jupyter has a CloudFlare account that controls the DNS for all of the Jupyter domains.

All **Executive Council** members have access to this account.

**Delegate to user accounts rather than using the shared account**.  CloudFlare allows you to [delegate access and control to user accounts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/manage/) which is strongly preferred over using the shared account.
service](#passwords); create a Cloudflare account using your own
username/password, and ask a Cloudflare admin to be added as a delegated user.
