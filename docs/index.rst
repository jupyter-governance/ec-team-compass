Why have a Team Compass?
========================

This repository helps the Jupyter Executive Council set a weekly
course for project activity. Our overriding goal is continuous team and
project improvement.

As projects and their growth evolve rapidly, the contents of this repo
should aid us in setting project direction and adjusting the course as
needed. The repo contains:

- team meeting agendas and archives
- direction and action plans
- communication and culture of respectful teamwork
- recognitions and team celebrations

How decisions are made
======================

The Jupyter Executive Council follows the
`"Decision Making" Guidelines <https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making>`_ described in the main Jupyter governance documents.

In short, we'll first seek an informal consensus. If a clear consensus cannot be reached, an active council member can call for a vote. The voting process then follows the guidelines laid out by the `Jupyter Governance model <https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making>`_.


Code of Conduct
===============

The Jupyter Executive Council follows the broader
`Jupyter Community's Code of Conduct <https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html>`_.
